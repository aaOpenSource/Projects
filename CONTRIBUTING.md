How to Contribute
-----------------

This whole project is about bringing others together to contribute and share code. 
We really, really want you to pitch in and help us build up a great base of code for all ArchestrA developers.

So, how can you contribute?

## Existing Code

* Check out an existing project, try it out, and submit issues back here. 
* If you have a solution, feel free to create a merge request and contribute back in to the code. 

If you aren't comfortable with merge requests, give us a shout and let's walk through it together.

Check out [Contributing to Open Source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing) from
GitHub to get a nice guide on how to get rolling with issues and pull requests.

## New Projects

If you have code that is an entirely new project and is unrelated to any of our existing projects, you have two choices:

1. Create your own repository under your own account and we'll add it to our [Projects page](http://aaopensource.org/projects/).
2. We can create a new repository under aaOpenSource for your code to live.

Either way, [create a new issue here](https://github.com/aaOpenSource/Projects/issues) and we'll take care of it!
